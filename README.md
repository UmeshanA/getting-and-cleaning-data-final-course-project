# Getting and Cleaning Data Final Course Project
Final Course Project for Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course


## Introduction
 The data set used in this course project comes from accelerometers found in Samsung Galaxy SII smartphones. The goal of this final course project is to read the data, clean it and output a tidy data set that can be used for further data wrangling.  
 
 This task is achieved by run_analysis.R, a R code script that:  
 1) Reads the data (provided that it is in the current working directory)  
 2) Merges the training and the test data to create one data set  
 3) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and the standard deviation for each of the measurements  
 4) Uses descriptive names to name the activites in the data set  
 5) Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names
 6) Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.   
 
 
## CodeBook
 The Code Book file in the repository has a description of the variables found in the tidy data set.
